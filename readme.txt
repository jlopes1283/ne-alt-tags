The purpose of alt attributes is to provide a description of the contents of an image file on your website. 

== Description ==

NE Alt Tags is a Wordpress plugin that allows the user to easily view images throughout their website that doesn't have any alternative text associated with it and update it throughout your whole website in a couple steps.

If the website has images in the Media Library without alternative text, it will prompt a message throughout every page on the admin side. If you see this message, follow the steps below: 
	1. Click on the "Show" link. This will show just all of the images without alt tags and will be highlighted in red.
	2. Click on the image you would like to give an alt text to.
	3. In the field labeled "Alternative Text", fill out the appropriate information that would explain in describe the image in detail.
	4. Click the "Update" button

THAT'S IT!
Now that the image has alternative text, it will automatically update on every page of your site no matter how many pages or posts it is on. No need to go into every page or post and individually update the image alt tags.
